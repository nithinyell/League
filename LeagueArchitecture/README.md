## Agenda
The most important features in the League platform is the ability to manage uploads. These uploads may exist in a few different places

* Images supporting a claim, like receipts, prescriptions, doctor's note, etc.
* Personal or recurring documents, like your ID, gym membership, Beneficiary Form, etc.
* Our Customer Care team needs to be able to review these documents for accuracy in their own section of the app.
 
High level front-end architecture of new upload management system. There are a few actions to keep in mind
* The member would like to upload documents.
* The member would like to view uploaded documents.
* The member would like to add metadata to a document.
* The member may want to edit a document later.
* The member may want to delete a document.
* Submitting a claim is in a different spot in the app, but the member still needs to upload supporting documents.
* The customer care agent would like to view uploaded documents.
* The customer care agent would like to access associated documents while processing claims.
