## Agenda
The most important features in the League platform is the ability to manage uploads. These uploads may exist in a few different places

* Images supporting a claim, like receipts, prescriptions, doctor's note, etc.
* Personal or recurring documents, like your ID, gym membership, Beneficiary Form, etc.
* Our Customer Care team needs to be able to review these documents for accuracy in their own section of the app.
 
High level front-end architecture of new upload management system. There are a few actions to keep in mind
* The member would like to upload documents.
* The member would like to view uploaded documents.
* The member would like to add metadata to a document.
* The member may want to edit a document later.
* The member may want to delete a document.
* Submitting a claim is in a different spot in the app, but the member still needs to upload supporting documents.
* The customer care agent would like to view uploaded documents.
* The customer care agent would like to access associated documents while processing claims.

## Approach

* Login In & Sign Up View Controllers to authenticate
* Tab View Controller for Claims & Documeents
* Claim & Document Detail View Controllers

## Web Services
Client Server Interaction - ```Amazon S3 or Azure Cloud```

* getAccessToken(): fetch access token for specific user
* getClaims(): fetch list of user claims
* getClaim?userid=12345(): fetch specific claim of user with help of query param
* getDocuments(): fetch list of user documents
* getDocument?userid=12345(): fetch specific document of user with help if query param
* submitClaim(): post new claim
* uploadNewDocunemt(): post new document data i.e image data (multipart/form-data)

## Design Patterns

MVVM is the most commonly used architecture for mobile apps. This encourages loosly coupled components and also testing would be made easy

App Modules help to separate the code and ease updates/change request to apps

## Backlog
* Implement ```api pagination``` to deal with numerous claims in claims list view controller. Same should be followed for documents list
* Integrate ```encription and decription using AES scripting``` to secure the user data on mobile device
* ```SSL Pinning``` should be added in order to escape middle man attacks
* Use ```Xcode Profiles``` to enhance the app performance
* Add ```telemetry``` and collect data to understand the user activity
* Implement ```Push Notifications``` to know the statuc of the claims

## Libraries
Though I am a big fan of using iOS Native APIS, there are plenty open sources libraries doing amazing job
* [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) provided best apis to make service calls
* Cache implementation for offline data loading
